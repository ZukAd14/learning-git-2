        <h2>Open Your Eyes</h2>
        <h3>by Guano Apes</h3>
        <p>Hide your face forever 
           Dream and search forever 
           Have you ever been for sale?
           When your isms get smart
           Oh so selfish and mindless
           With that comment in your eye
           Do you think that you are hard?
           Really harder than the others
           Man you're acting cold If you are not in charge
           Don't split your mentality Without thinking twice
           Your voice has got no reason
           Now is the time to face your lies
           REFREN: Open your eyes, open your mind
           Proud like a God don't pretend to be blind
           Trapped in yourself, break out instead
           Beat the machine that works in your head
           Will you offer me some tricks
           If I ever need them
           Would you go into that room
           If I call 'em
           Do you think that you are better
           Really better than the rest
           You realized there's a problem
           I know that you can give your best
           Have you ever had a dream?
           Or is life just a trip?
           A trip without chances
           A chance to grow up quick
           REFREN: Open your eyes, open your mind
           Proud like a God don't pretend to be blind
           Trapped in yourself, break out instead
           Beat the machine that works in your head
           Hide your face forever
           Dream and search forever
           Night and night you feel nothing
           There's no way outside of my land
           REFREN: Open your eyes, open your mind
           Proud like a God don't pretend to be blind
           Trapped in yourself, break out instead
           Beat the machine that works in your head
           Open your eyes, open your mind
           Proud like a God don't pretend to be blind
           Trapped in yourself, break out instead
           Beat the machine that works in your head
